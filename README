ctronome v0.2

GNU/GPL copying rules apply, see COPYING

INTRODUCTION:
 ctronome is a very-very simple programmable console metronome for Linux
 with /dev/dsp audio output. BPM ranges from 30 to 250, tacts like 3/4, 7/8
 etc. are possible. Uses external WAV files, so its sound is easily adjustable
 to meet your taste.

 Aim is to keep it as simple as it can be so dummies like me may understand
 and modify it. (The source code looks ugly though;)

COMPILE-TIME CONFIGURATION:
 edit ctronome.h for defaults, the most important ones are:
 metronomewav1 = "/usr/share/ctronome/metronome1.wav\0";
 metronomewav2 = "/usr/share/ctronome/metronome2.wav\0";
 dspdev = "/dev/dsp\0";

 They speak for themselves.
 
COMPILATION:
 I tried to make ctronome as simple as possible. Only the very basic
 libraries are needed that I believe to exist on every libc based
 Linuxes. You need to have Linux kernel header files installed.

 Go into ctronome source directory and type 'make'.
 It should compile whithout errors.

INSTALLATION:
 It is not really an issue as ctronome is a single binary. You can put it
 anywhere you want. You will need two preferably short WAV files as
 metronome sample, put in the place you specified in ctronome.h
 Two sample WAVs are included (recorded from a real metronome ;).

RUNNING:
 ctronome -b <bpm> -t <bpt> -c <count> -w1 <wav1> -w2 <wav2> -d <dsp_device> \
          -p <program> -h -v
    -b <bpm>            beat per minute default: 60/4, range: 30-250/1-50
    -t <bpt>            beat per tact default: 1/4, range: 1-50/1-50
    -p <filename>       program file
    -c <count>          play tact/program <count> times then exit
    -w1 <filename>      wav to use for first beat of tact
                         default: /usr/share/ctronome/metronome1.wav
    -w2 <filename>      wav to use for other beat of tact
                         default: /usr/share/ctronome/metronome2.wav
    -d <device>         dsp device, default /dev/dsp
    -h                  display help screen

   See prog_example.txt to learn how to program ctronome.

   For BPM you can specify the base note. E.g. 60/4 means:
   60 1/4 notes per minute -> length of 1/4 note is 1 second.

   For BPT you can also define the base note. E.g. 4/4 means:
   4 1/4 notes per tact -> length of a tact is 4 seconds.

   As you can see, it is now possible to specify the BPM in 1/4 notes,
   and then you can use BPT like 7/8, ctronome calculates lenght of 1/8 note
   (which is half of the 1/4 in this example) and plays seven of them for a
   tact.

   If the base note for BPM is not specified, it defaults to the base note
   of the tact.
   
   required WAV format is 16bit mono 44100Hz litte endian byte ordering.
   If you specify anything other than that, the metronome sound will
   be *khm* interesting, as no check is made for correct WAV format yet.
