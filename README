ctronome v0.1

GNU/GPL copying rules apply, see COPYING

INTRODUCTION:
 ctronome es a very-very simple console metronome for Linux with /dev/dsp
 audio output. BPM ranges from 30 to 250, tacts like 2/4, 3/4 are possible.
 Uses external WAV files, so its sound is easily adjustable to meet your
 taste.
 Aim is to keep it as simple as it can be so dummies like me may understand
 and modify it.

 The source code looks ugly though;)

COMPILE-TIME CONFIGURATION:
 edit ctronome.h for defaults, the most important ones are:
 metronomewav1 = "/usr/share/ctronome/metronome1.wav\0";
 metronomewav2 = "/usr/share/ctronome/metronome2.wav\0";
 dspdev = "/dev/dsp\0";

 They speak for themselves.
 
COMPILATION:
 I tried to make ctronome as simple as possible. Only the very basic
 libraries are needed that I believe to exist on every libc based
 Linuxes. You need to have Linux kernel header files installed.

 Go into ctronome source directory and type 'make'.
 It should compile whithout errors.

INSTALLATION:
 It is not really an issue as ctronome is a single binary. You can put it
 anywhere you want. You will need two preferably short WAV files as
 metronome sample, put in the place you specified in ctronome.h
 Two sample WAVs are included (recorded from a real metronome ;).

RUNNING:
 ctronome -b <bpm> -t <bpt> -w1 <wav1> -w2 <wav2> -d <dsp_device> -h
    -b <bpm>            beat per minute default: 60, range: 30-250
    -t <bpt>            beat per tact default: 1, range: 1-50
                         2 for 2/4, 3 for 3/4 and so on
    -w1 <filename>      wav to use for first beat of tact
                         default: /usr/share/ctronome/metronome1.wav
    -w2 <filename>      wav to use for other beat of tact
                         default: /usr/share/ctronome/metronome2.wav
    -d <device>         dsp device, default /dev/dsp
    -h                  display help screen
 
   required WAV format is 16bit mono 44100Hz litte endian byte ordering.
   If you specify anything other than that, the metronome sound will
   be *khm* interesting, as no check is made for correct WAV format yet.
