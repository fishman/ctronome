Timing. There is no timing at all. ctronome just builds an audio sample
which is the correct lenght for the given BPM. The result is that it eats up
more system resource by constantly writing audio stream to /dev/dsp.
Not too much but still, its not efficient.

I also assume that the soundcard driver blocks the program
if the dsp buffer is full. If it does not, well, its a problem.

The format of the program file is not strictly checked, however I do
not expect ctronome to segfault on a badly formed program.
